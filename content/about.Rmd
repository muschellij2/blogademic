## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
data(canada.cities, package = "maps")
viz <- ggplot(canada.cities, aes(long, lat)) +
  borders(regions = "canada") +
  coord_equal() +
  geom_point(aes(text = name, size = pop), colour = "red", alpha = 1/2)
ggplotly(viz, tooltip = c("text", "size"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
